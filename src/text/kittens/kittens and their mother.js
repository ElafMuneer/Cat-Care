        <h3 className="title">How do I care for newborn kittens and their mother?</h3>
        <p className="textt">There are many things that you need to consider when caring for kittens and a lactating mother. The following information addresses some of the most important issues however, the RSPCA strongly recommends that you seek veterinary advice to ensure that your cat and her kittens receive the best care possible.</p>
        <p className="text2">Nutrition</p>
        <p className="textt">Milk production requires a lot of energy and it is therefore necessary to increase the amount of food that you give your cat while she is lactating. Lactating cats should be fed free choice with appropriate food that is designed for lactation.

Where possible allow the kittens to wean naturally from their mother. This generally occurs by the time the kitten is about 8 weeks of age. It is important for them to receive their mother’s milk up until this age as it contains substances that are vital to their health and immunity. Consult your vet for advice on how to slowly introduce your kittens onto solid food once it is time to begin weaning them. Please see the article titled “What should I feed my kitten?” for more information about kitten nutrition.</p>
        <p className="text2">Socialisation</p>
        <p className="textt">Socialisation is also an important aspect of a kitten’s development and it is important that your kittens have had plenty of time to socialise with their siblings and mother as well as humans before sending them off to their new loving homes. Gentle handling and patting by humans is important during this phase. Calmly and positively introducing kittens to different objects (such as vacuum cleaners, umbrellas etc.) that they will likely encounter in their home as they grow older is also important. The more socialisation a kitten receives, the easier the transition to a new home and environment will be.</p>
        <p className="text2">Veterinary care</p>
        <p className="textt">Talk to your vet about kitten vaccinations, desexing, microchipping and health care such as worming and flea prevention. RSPCA Australia advocates the desexing of all pet cats (which are kept as companion animals) to reduce the population of unwanted cats and kittens in the community. Consult your vet for more information about cat desexing and please consider having your cat desexed after she has weaned her kittens. Kittens should be desexed before 16 weeks of age as they can mate and become pregnant at this age.</p>
