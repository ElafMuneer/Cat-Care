          <p className="textt">Daily (or at least twice weekly) brushing is the key to keeping your cat’s teeth and gums healthy.5 Adult cats can be pretty resistant to having their teeth cleaned, so it’s a good idea to get them used to this process and to having your fingers in their mouth from when they’re kittens. Use a finger cot (a single ‘glove finger’ that can be used when a full-handed glove is not required) or a piece of gauze covered in toothpaste made for cats to ease your kitten into the experience. Covering your finger in the water from a can of tuna will also make the experience more pleasant for them.</p>
          <p className="textt">For your cat’s regular teeth cleaning routine, it’s important to make sure you have all the right equipment. Complete dental kits can be purchased from veterinary clinics and pet stores. Cats should never, under any circumstances, have their teeth cleaned with human toothpaste. The high levels of fluoride often found in human toothpaste can make your cat severely ill if ingested, and as you’re limited when it comes to controlling how much of the toothpaste they swallow, it’s important to avoid this.Fluoride-free toothpaste designed for cats is readily available and is often flavoured with beef or chicken</p>
          <p className="textt">You can brush your cat’s teeth with either sterile gauze strips or a rubber toothbrush or finger brush that’s especially designed for cats. Cradle them from behind so they feel comforted and supported, gently tilt their head back, and lift up their chin to open their mouths and make it easy for you to access their teeth.Never use dental floss. It’s a common household item that poses a severe danger to cats due to the risk of swallowing and intestinal damage.</p>
