          <p className="textt">It is best to avoid hugging your  cat because, although a tight hug is often a sign of affection between people, it can feel threatening to  a cat. To survive in the wild, cats had to be able to use their bodies freely and being held down or restrained usually meant they were in serious trouble (such as being caught by a predator). Therefore, instinctively a cat can become afraid when restrained, such as when held in a hug.</p>
          <p className="textt">Restraining or hugging cats can cause them to become afraid and frustrated. This is a natural and common response of the cat when they feel they do not have control over a situation and can be associated with aggressive behaviour when they are irritated or restrained. In the wild, cats are a generally alone and the need to be in control is an essential part of their survival behaviour.</p>
          <p className="textt">In general, it is best for both adults and children to avoid hugging their pets and instead interact with gentle pets/strokes for cats preferably chin or face rubs/strokes/scratches.</p>
